# globalTerrorismExploratoryAnalysis

This repository contains a straightforward exploratory analysis on the global terrorism dataset. The main questions addressed are: 

- What "clusters" of terrorism can be found throughout history 
- What groups are responsible for these peaks in terrorism 

A report detailing the investigative process is found in "ReportBensPart.Rmd" and "ReportBensPart.html", and a some more exploratory work not included in the report is found in "cluster_gtd_time.Rmd". A script for scraping population data is in add_population_data.Rmd. Graphs generated in the final report shown below:
